Great job on completing the To-Do List application! Here's another project
recommendation that will help you further expand your skills as a junior Golang
backend programmer:

**Project Recommendation: Building a Simple Blogging Platform**

**Project Description:**
Create a basic blogging platform where users can create, read, update, and
delete blog posts. This project will provide you with experience in building
more complex web applications, working with databases, and managing user
interactions.

**Features to Implement:**

1. **User Registration and Login:** Allow users to register for an account and
   log in to the platform.

2. **Create Blog Post:** Implement a feature for authenticated users to create new
   blog posts with a title, content, and optional tags.

3. **View Blog Posts:** Design a page where users can see a list of all blog posts,
   sorted by the most recent ones.

4. **View Individual Blog Post:** Allow users to click on a blog post from the
   list to view its full content.

5. **Update Blog Post:** Enable the author of a blog post to edit and update the
   content.

6. **Delete Blog Post:** Implement a feature that allows the author to delete
   their blog post.

**Additional Challenges:**
To make this project more advanced and feature-rich, consider adding the
following functionalities:

1. **User Roles and Permissions:** Implement different user roles (e.g., admin,
   regular user) with varying permissions for managing blog posts.

2. **Comments:** Allow users to comment on blog posts and enable the author to
   manage comments (approve, delete).

3. **Categories and Tags:** Add the ability to categorize blog posts using tags or
   categories, allowing users to filter posts based on these criteria.

4. **Search Functionality:** Implement a search feature that enables users to
   search for specific blog posts based on keywords.

5. **Pagination:** Add pagination to the list of blog posts to improve performance
   and user experience.

6. **User Profiles:** Create user profiles where users can see their published blog
   posts and some additional information.

**Learning Opportunities:**
By working on this project, you will gain valuable experience in the following
areas:

- Working with databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store and retrieve blog
  posts and user information.
- Implementing user authentication and authorization for secure access.
- Handling complex interactions between users and blog posts (create, read,
  update, delete operations).
- Managing relationships between different entities (users, blog posts,
  comments).
- Designing and optimizing database schemas for efficiency.
- Implementing search functionality and pagination for large datasets.
- Exploring how to deploy and host a web application in a production
  environment.

**Tips:**

- Consider using a Golang web framework like "gin" or "echo" to simplify the
  development process.
- Leverage third-party packages for features like user authentication and
  database access to speed up development.
- Pay attention to code organization, scalability, and maintainability.
- Test your application thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected and handles
  edge cases gracefully.

Remember, the key is to continuously challenge yourself, learn new concepts,
and build upon your existing skills. Best of luck with your new project!
